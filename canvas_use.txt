to make a canvas aided graphical app you must :-

1. MainActivity should extend Activity

2. content view should be changed to "your custom view" setContentView(new myview(this);

3.// my view constructor should have  super(context);

4.one should aso use threads to "update>>draw to canvas"

5 thread should draw to canvas 
	 to draw it needs  "surfaceholder,canvas,draw functionfrom playerview or gameview class"

canvas is not passed down. the thread shoukd have its own canvas.


6 at the thread we overide the run method.

// we make an in finite while looop which is the main game update and render loop


7 at our custom view " our view " we make an instance of the game thread.
	set running to true.
	start the thread.
	
8 at the thread run method.
	 we check if surface is valid;
	we lock the canvas 
we draw to the canvas 
we unlock canvas and post view to the screen.
